As cinema evolved through the 20th century, its emotional landscape shifted, shaped not only by technological innovations but also by global crises. From the rise of joy with the advent of sound and color to the diverging roles of sadness after 9/11, movies have reflected—and responded to—the cultural and emotional pulse of their times.

In this analysis, we uncover how key moments in history shaped the way emotions like joy, fear, disgust, and sadness were portrayed on screen.


### A New Dawn for Joy: Technology Brings Color and Sound
The evolution of emotions in movies before and after pivotal technological milestones reveals a fascinating trend. Our analysis, visualized in the graphs below, shows a marked increase in the presence of **joy** in films from the period of 1930-1940 compared to those made before 1922.

This shift aligns with two groundbreaking innovations in cinema history:

1. **The Advent of Color (1922)**: The introduction of color in films brought a new dimension to storytelling. Vibrant visuals allowed filmmakers to create more engaging and optimistic scenes, making emotions like **joy** more visually impactful and memorable.

2. **The Introduction of Sound (1927)**: The emergence of "talkies" revolutionized the cinematic experience. Music, dialogue, and sound effects enabled movies to convey emotions more dynamically, enhancing the audience's emotional connection to the characters and the story.

These technological advancements likely explain why **joy** becomes more prominent in movies after these milestones. With the ability to combine color and sound, filmmakers could evoke positive emotions with greater intensity and nuance, ushering in a new era of emotionally resonant storytelling.


### A Potential Shift in Disgust and Fear
In addition to joy, we notice potential differences in the portrayal of disgust and fear over time. These differences prompt further investigation into their potential causes. While one might attribute such shifts to advancements in cinematic techniques, such as the introduction of sound or color, these innovations occurred much later. Instead, we hypothesize that global events like World War I (1914–1918) may have played a significant role in shaping audience preferences and emotional storytelling. To explore this hypothesis, we will analyze how the war’s unprecedented societal impact influenced the evolving emotional tone of films during this period.

1. **The Decline of Disgust**: Before 1914, disgust featured prominently in films, often tied to grotesque or discomforting imagery. However, as the war unfolded, its presence diminished. The unprecedented violence and suffering of World War I left audiences weary of confronting unpleasant themes on screen. Filmmakers shifted focus, favoring narratives of hope and escapism over discomfort. 

2. **The Rise of Fear**: In contrast, fear became a dominant emotional theme in cinema during this time. The war introduced new, universal anxieties: the unpredictability of conflict, the constant threat of loss, and a destabilized world. These fears naturally found their way into storytelling, reflected in suspenseful plots and narratives of survival. Fear also served a dual purpose in films—it mirrored collective anxieties while offering a safe space for audiences to process them. Stories of danger and resilience provided both emotional catharsis and a connection to the shared experience of a world gripped by uncertainty.



### The Diverging Faces of Sadness After 9/11
The emotional landscape of cinema shifted once again after the 9/11 attacks. Sadness, in particular, charted two very distinct paths depending on the genre:

The emotional trajectory of sadness in cinema tells a story of adaptation and purpose, with two genres—**family/animation** and **romance**—charting distinct paths after 9/11.  

Before the attacks, sadness followed relatively consistent patterns across genres. But as the world grappled with collective grief, filmmakers responded differently, depending on their audience. The result? A drop in sadness for family and animated films but a rise in romance, reflecting the emotional needs of a society in recovery.  


1. **Family/Animation: A Retreat From Sadness**: For family and animated films, sadness declines sharply in the post-9/11 period. This genre, often a source of comfort for younger audiences, shifted its focus toward optimistic and uplifting stories. The drop in sadness could reflect a conscious effort by creators to shield audiences from heavy emotional themes, offering escapism instead of reminders of real-world grief.


2. **Romance: Leaning Into Sadness**: In contrast, romance films embraced sadness, with the emotion becoming more prominent post-9/11. This genre, defined by themes of love, loss, and vulnerability, may have provided a space for audiences to process their feelings. As people sought to make sense of their own emotional experiences, romance films likely resonated by offering catharsis through stories that explored longing, heartbreak, and human connection. In this way, the rise of sadness in romance reflects cinema’s ability to mirror society’s deeper emotional currents.
