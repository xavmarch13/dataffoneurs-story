In the early days of cinema, much like in Babylon where Nellie LaRoy danced her way into silent film stardom, movies were a feast for the eyes but not yet for the ears. The world of Hollywood was chaotic, glamorous, and ripe for innovation. Then came the turning points that changed everything: the introduction of color in 1922 and sound in 1927.  

These groundbreaking advancements didn’t just change how films were made; they revolutionized the emotional language of cinema. Joy, fear, and disgust—emotions that had already found a place on the silent screen—shifted in prominence.

## **The rise of joy: when movies learned to speak and shine**  


Before 1922, emotions in films were conveyed through exaggerated gestures, silent stares, and title cards. Joy existed but was subdued—struggling to shine through the monochrome lens of silent cinema. Nellie’s analysis reveals how technological breakthroughs reshaped emotions like joy, fear, sadness, and surprise, reflecting both industry innovations and societal changes.

1. **The advent of color (1922):** Color brought vibrancy to the screen, enabling filmmakers to portray happiness and optimism with unparalleled visual richness. This technological leap made emotions like joy more expressive and memorable.

2. **The power of sound (1927):** Sound revolutionized storytelling by adding music, dialogue, and sound effects. It gave emotions a dynamic new dimension—joy became more uplifting, fear more chilling, and surprise more impactful through unexpected sounds and twists.

The graphs tell a clear story. Joy surged with the advent of sound and color, reflecting the industry’s ability to evoke happiness more effectively. Meanwhile, fear steadily grew as filmmakers began crafting suspenseful and thrilling narratives. Disgust declined during this period. Sadness and surprise also evolved, sound allowed for more nuanced portrayals of grief, while surprise gained depth through dramatic audio cues and sudden plot twists.

All these changes seemed to align, but Nellie suspected there was more at play. Could global events like World War I, with its unprecedented loss and societal upheaval, have shaped cinema's emotional tone? The stark shifts in fear and disgust hinted at storytelling influenced not just by technological innovation but by a society grappling with the scars of war. Nellie’s exploration into cinema's emotional evolution was far from over.

## **A shadow of war: how WW1 reshaped fear and disgust**

During the silent film era, fear and disgust were already present, but something changed after World War I. Before the war, films often portrayed discomfort or grotesque imagery, reflecting audiences’ fascination with the new medium. However, after the war, the emotional tone shifted.

1. **The decline of disgust**: Audiences had already witnessed unimaginable horrors during the war. Nellie’s analysis shows that filmmakers turned away from themes that evoked disgust, as viewers craved hope and escapism more than ever.

2. **The rise of fear**: At the same time, fear became more dominant. The war introduced new anxieties—conflict, loss, and a destabilized world—and cinema reflected this. Suspenseful narratives and stories of survival became tools to mirror collective anxieties while also helping audiences process them.

Just like Nellie couldn’t adapt when sound took over Hollywood, the film industry had to adapt to a world changed by war. Fear became a new emotional anchor, reflecting a society still grappling with its trauma.

## **The diverging faces of sadness after 9/11**

The emotional landscape of cinema shifted once again after the 9/11 attacks. Sadness, in particular, split into two distinct paths depending on the genre.

1. **Family/Animation**: Sadness dropped sharply. Post-9/11, family and animated films became more uplifting, offering audiences optimism and comfort in a time of grief. Filmmakers understood that younger audiences needed hope, not reminders of real-world sadness.

2. **Romance**: Sadness surged. Romance films leaned into themes of love, loss, and longing, providing a space for audiences to process their emotions. These films mirrored the collective grief of society but also offered catharsis through heartfelt stories of connection.

## **Conclusion: a story of innovation and emotion**

Through this analysis, Nellie uncovered how cinema evolved alongside history. Sound and color brought joy to the screen, but war and tragedy left their mark, shifting emotions like fear, disgust, and sadness. Just like in *Babylon*, where the rise of sound reshaped everything, movies have always reflected the world around them—its beauty, its chaos, and its heart.
