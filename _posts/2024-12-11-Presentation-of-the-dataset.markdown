#What's in the data? (mettre qch de mieux)
# ðŸŽ¥ *Ladies and Gentlemen, Please Welcome... the CMU Movie Summary Corpus Dataset!* ðŸŽ¤

**Jimmy Fallon enters, applause erupts**  
"Alright, folks, youâ€™re in for a real treat tonight! This isnâ€™t just any regular guest. This is a STAR. A true legend of the cinematic universe. Please give a warm Late Night welcome to... the **CMU Movie Summary Corpus Dataset**!"

### *The Dataset Takes the Stage*  
**The spotlight shines on the dataset, which speaks in a confident tone**:  
"Thank you, Jimmy, and hello, everyone! Let me introduce myself. Iâ€™m the **CMU Movie Summary Corpus Dataset**, and let me tell you, Iâ€™ve got RANGE.  

- Iâ€™ve been collecting stories since **1893**, spanning over a century of cinema!  
- I hold **34,342 movie plot summaries**, packed with all the metadata you can imagine.  
- My genres? Oh, Iâ€™ve got EVERYTHING: Western, Crime, Romance, Animationâ€”you name it, Iâ€™ve got it. Some movies couldnâ€™t even pick just one, so theyâ€™re rocking multiple genres.  

Hereâ€™s a quick peek at my *Top 100 Genre Distribution*. Itâ€™s like the Golden Globes, but for movie categories:

Thank you, thank you!"

### *Jimmy Jumps In*  
"Wow, incredible! But thatâ€™s not all, is it? Youâ€™re global, right? Youâ€™re everywhere!"  

**Dataset chuckles confidently**:  
"Oh, you bet. Movies from all over the world, Jimmy. And Iâ€™ve been keeping track of their release dates too. Sure, weâ€™ve got a bias toward the West and more recent filmsâ€”Hollywood does love to dominateâ€”but letâ€™s not forget the hidden gems from every corner of the globe. Check this out:  

<iframe src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/plot/dataset_presentation/movie_where_and_when_subplots.html" width="100%" height="700" frameborder="0"></iframe>  

What can I say? Iâ€™m a global phenomenon."

### *Jimmy Digs Deeper*  
"Alright, but tell usâ€”what about genres by continent? Youâ€™ve got something for everyone, donâ€™t you?"  

**Dataset nods knowingly**:  
"Oh, absolutely. Different continents have their own movie vibes. Whether itâ€™s Action in North America or Romantic dramas in Europe, Iâ€™ve got the scoop. Check out how the categories stack up by continent:  

<iframe src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/plot/dataset_presentation/distribution_of_movies_per_continent_subplots.html" width="100%" height="600" frameborder="0"></iframe>  

Letâ€™s just say, Iâ€™m the ultimate globe-trotting storyteller."

### *When the Dataset Needed a Boost*  
**Jimmy leans in, curious**:  
"Alright, but come on, every star has had their struggles. Whatâ€™s the behind-the-scenes story? Was it all smooth sailing?"  

**Dataset sighs**:  
"Well, not exactly. Like every great story, mine had its challenges. Some of my movie summaries were... letâ€™s just say, a little *thin*. Missing details, way too short, or just plain incomplete. So, we went out there, rolled up our sleeves, and *scraped* the data we needed to fill in the gaps.

And Jimmy, thatâ€™s not all! We didnâ€™t stop at summaries. Oh no, we went the extra mile and scraped **movie ratings** too. Now, Iâ€™m not just a storytellerâ€”Iâ€™m a full-fledged movie critic. With this extra data, Iâ€™ve never looked better!"

### *Jimmyâ€™s Big Reveal*  
"Alright, alright, letâ€™s get real. This dataset isnâ€™t just sitting in some library, folks. No, this dataset is a STAR. Youâ€™ve seen it in the biggest blockbusters:  

- *Oppenheimer*: 'The science behind the scenes.'  
- *Barbie*: 'Pink never looked so data-driven.'  
- *Enigma*: 'Where plot twists meet reality.'  
- *Babylon*: 'Cinema in its purest form.'  
- *Indiana Jones*: 'Archaeology of cinema history.'  

And tonight, weâ€™re going to dive into the datasetâ€™s career. What made it a star? How did it land these big roles? And whatâ€™s next? Stick around to find outâ€”itâ€™s going to be one epic Late Night deep dive!"  

**Audience cheers as the dataset waves confidently. The stage is set for a full exploration of its cinematic journey.**
