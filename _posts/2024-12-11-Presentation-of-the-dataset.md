# ðŸŽ¥ *Ladies and Gentlemen, Please Welcome... the CMU Movie Summary Corpus Dataset!* ðŸŽ¤

**Jimmy Fallon enters, applause erupts**  
"Alright, folks, youâ€™re in for a real treat tonight! This isnâ€™t just any regular guest. This is a STAR. A true legend of the cinematic universe. Please give a warm Late Night welcome to... the **CMU Movie Summary Corpus Dataset**!"

### *The Dataset Takes the Stage*  
**The spotlight shines on the dataset, which speaks in a confident tone**:  
"Thank you, Jimmy, and hello, everyone! Let me introduce myself. Iâ€™m the **CMU Movie Summary Corpus Dataset**, and let me tell you, Iâ€™ve got RANGE.  

- Iâ€™ve been collecting stories since **1893**, spanning over a century of cinema!  
- I hold **34,342 movie plot summaries**, packed with all the metadata you can imagine.  
- My genres? Oh, Iâ€™ve got EVERYTHING: Western, Crime, Romance, Animationâ€”you name it, Iâ€™ve got it. Some movies couldnâ€™t even pick just one, so theyâ€™re rocking multiple genres.  

Hereâ€™s a quick peek at my *Top 100 Genre Distribution*. Itâ€™s like the Golden Globes, but for movie categories:

Thank you, thank you! Youâ€™re too kind. Now, looking at my Top 100 Genre Distribution, you might think, 'Wow, this dataset really has its act together.' And youâ€™d be right! But let me tell you, Jimmy, the road to this glamorous distribution wasnâ€™t as straightforward as it seems. You see, I used to be a bit of a messâ€”genres everywhere, with movies claiming to belong to 20 different categories at once! It was chaos.

So, what did we do? We rolled up our sleeves, put on our thinking caps, and mapped similar genres together. Cyberpunk and Alien invasion? Now neatly tucked under Fantasy/Sci-Fi. Zombie Film and Monster movie? Safely home in Horror. And voilÃ ! We went from a cluttered chaos of hundreds of genres to a sleek, streamlined list that tells a clear story.

Itâ€™s like taking a scattered script and turning it into a blockbuster screenplay. Now, when you look at my genre distribution, youâ€™re not just seeing dataâ€”youâ€™re seeing a masterpiece of organization. Less confusion, more impact. And trust me, Jimmy, Iâ€™ve never looked better."

### *Jimmy Jumps In*  
"Wow, incredible! But thatâ€™s not all, is it? Youâ€™re global, right? Youâ€™re everywhere!"  

**Dataset chuckles confidently**:  
"Oh, you bet. Movies from all over the world, Jimmy. And Iâ€™ve been keeping track of their release dates too. Sure, weâ€™ve got a bias toward the West and more recent filmsâ€”Hollywood does love to dominateâ€”but letâ€™s not forget the hidden gems from every corner of the globe. Check this out:  

<iframe src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/plot/dataset_presentation/movie_where_and_when_subplots.html" width="100%" height="700" frameborder="0"></iframe>  

What can I say? Iâ€™m a global phenomenon."

### *Jimmy Digs Deeper*  
"Alright, but tell usâ€”what about genres by continent? Youâ€™ve got something for everyone, donâ€™t you?"  

**Dataset nods knowingly**:  
"Oh, absolutely. Different continents have their own movie vibes. Whether itâ€™s Action in North America or Romantic dramas in Europe, Iâ€™ve got the scoop. Check out how the categories stack up by continent:  

<iframe src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/plot/dataset_presentation/distribution_of_movies_per_continent_subplots.html" width="100%" height="600" frameborder="0"></iframe>  

Letâ€™s just say, Iâ€™m the ultimate globe-trotting storyteller."

### *When the Dataset Needed a Boost*  
**Jimmy leans in, curious**:  
"Alright, but come on, every star has had their struggles. Whatâ€™s the behind-the-scenes story? Was it all smooth sailing?"  

**Dataset sighs**:  
"Well, not exactly. Like every great story, mine had its challenges. Some of my movie summaries were... letâ€™s just say, a little *thin*. Missing details, way too short, or just plain incomplete. So, we went out there, rolled up our sleeves, and *scraped* the data we needed to fill in the gaps.

<iframe src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/plot/dataset_presentation/missing_values_summary.html" width="100%" height="600" frameborder="0"></iframe>  
And Jimmy, thatâ€™s not all! We didnâ€™t stop at summaries. Oh no, we went the extra mile and scraped **movie ratings** too. Now, Iâ€™m not just a storytellerâ€”Iâ€™m a full-fledged movie critic. With this extra data, Iâ€™ve never looked better! You can see this histogram of the main ratings of the dataset right below!"
