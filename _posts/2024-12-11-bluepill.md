## **Can we classify films by anything other than genre?**
As Neo dive back in the data, the question arises: Can emotions help us discover hidden trends in movies? Are North American drama films emotionally similar to European thrillers? Let's dive into his analysis and see what emerges.

Neo starts by looking at the Elbow Method and Silhouette Score graphs, from whom he can draw a few conclusions about clustering films by emotion:

- **Elbow Method**: The graph shows a sharp drop in inertia from 2 to 4 clusters, followed by a more gradual decrease. The "elbow" appears around 4-5 clusters, suggesting that this is the optimal number for the dataset.

- **Silhouette Score**: The scores, ranging from 0.13 to 0.17, indicate that the clusters overlap and aren't well-separated. The score peaks at 6-7 clusters, but declines sharply after that.

Combining both methods:
- The Elbow Method suggests 4-5 clusters for computational efficiency, while the Silhouette Score favors 6-7 for better-defined clusters.
- This suggests that emotions in films overlap naturally, reflecting how movies often evoke multiple emotions at once.

Neo finds that having 7 clusters fits perfectly for the analysis as each cluster represents a category of films that is emotionally dominated by one particular feeling. For example, cluster 1 is filled with films that evoke the most anger, cluster 2 showcases films that generate the most joy, and so on.

Neo also plots the clustering through K-Means of the seven emotions in 3D for better visualization. (Analyse????)

Neo takes a closer look at the data through clustering analysis.

From here, Neo notices some interesting trends. Compared to the overall genre distribution, Action and Thriller films are overrepresented in clusters dominated by anger. In films where joy is most prevalent, there’s a notable overrepresentation of Drama, Romance, and Comedy films, while Thrillers and Horror films don’t show much joy. Comedy and Animation films tend to dominate when surprise is the most prominent emotion. Similar to cluster 2, films with high sadness are predominantly Drama and Romance. In cluster 5, which focuses on fear, Neo observes that Thrillers and Horror films are well-represented. Horror films also dominate when disgust is the most prevalent emotion. Finally, the cluster with the highest representation of Comedy, Family/Animation, and Fantasy-Sci-Fi films aligns with a more neutral emotional profile.

Neo also looked at how each genre is partitioned between different cluster to better understand the overall distribution of clusters across categories. These graphs supports Neo's analysis from above.

## Analysis of Cluster Distribution by Genre and Emotions

### Cluster 1 - Anger
- **Highest proportion of anger**: *30.3% in Action/Adventure*, *26.5% in Thriller*.  
- **Neo's Analysis**:  
Action and adventure films generate anger primarily through themes of conflict, rivalry, and injustice. Physical confrontations, chases, and revenge-driven plots are hallmarks of the genre, evoking strong emotional reactions.  
In dramas, anger arises from frustration caused by unjust or tragic situations faced by the characters. This often reflects the audience's identification with societal, familial, or personal conflicts.

### Cluster 2 - Joy
- **Highest proportion of joy**: *13.7% in Comedy*, *20% in Romance*.  
- **Neo's Analysis**:  
While comedies aim to evoke joy, the proportion remains relatively low (13.7%), likely because humor is often intertwined with surprise or neutral elements, creating a mixed emotional experience.  
In romances, joy is more prominent (20%) as these films focus on moments of happiness, fulfilled love, and positive resolutions of relational conflicts.

### Cluster 3 - Surprise
- **Highest proportion of surprise**: *11.3% in Family/Animation*, *9.89% in Comedy*.  
- **Neo's Analysis**:  
Family/animation and fantasy/science fiction films thrive on imaginative worlds, unexpected plot twists, and visually spectacular elements. These genres cultivate curiosity and wonder, which are core components of surprise.  
Plot reversals and magical or futuristic scenarios encourage viewers to explore new possibilities, evoking both surprise and fascination.

### Cluster 4 - Sadness
- **Highest proportion of sadness**: *20.7% in Romance*, *19.5% in Drama*.  
- **Neo's Analysis**:  
Dramas delve into emotions of loss, hardship, and human sacrifice, often presenting realistic emotional conflicts that evoke authentic sadness in viewers.  
Romances, while generating joy, also explore themes of heartbreak, unfulfilled love, or emotional dilemmas, leading to sadness when relational conflicts remain unresolved.

### Cluster 5 - Fear
- **Highest proportion of fear**: *29.7% in Horror*, *20.2% in Thriller*, *19.2% in Fantasy/Sci-Fi*.  
- **Neo's Analysis**:  
Horror films evoke primal fear and anxiety through themes of survival, imminent danger, or supernatural elements. Psychological theories suggest fear triggers strong physiological responses (adrenaline and muscle tension), enhancing audience immersion.  
Thrillers induce a more cognitive form of fear, relying on suspense, hidden threats, and plot twists to maintain a state of tension and unease.

### Cluster 6 - Disgust
- **Highest proportion of disgust**: *30.3% in Horror*.  
- **Neo's Analysis**:  
Horror films often elicit disgust through graphic, violent, or disturbing imagery. Disgust is tied to instinctual reactions of repulsion and self-preservation, amplifying the sensory impact of the viewing experience.

### Cluster 7 - Neutral
- **Highest proportion of neutrality**: *40.5% in Family/Animation*, *35.5% in Fantasy/Sci-Fi*.  
- **Neo's Analysis**:  
Family and comedy films tend to avoid extreme emotions, opting for light, balanced narratives that are accessible to broader audiences. This emotional neutrality reflects a desire to provide positive experiences without overwhelming viewers.

## General Conclusion

Neo's analysis of film clusters and their dominant emotions highlights a strong correlation between genres and emotional experiences, aligning with emotion theory:

- **Negative Emotions** (anger, sadness, fear, disgust):  
  - Predominant in *drama*, *thriller*, and *horror* genres, which explore themes of tension, loss, and threat.  
  - These emotions often provide catharsis for the audience and deepen immersion into the narrative.  

- **Positive Emotions** (joy, surprise):  
  - Prevalent in *comedy*, *romance*, and *family/animation* genres, which aim to create lighthearted, enjoyable, or awe-inspiring experiences.  
  - Optimistic storytelling and visually enchanting worlds help stimulate positive emotional responses.

- **Emotional Neutrality**:  
  - Associated with *family* and *comedy* films, neutrality allows for accessible, emotionally balanced content suited for a wide audience.  

### Summary  
Neo concludes that the clusters reflect an emotional specialization within film genres. Each genre serves a unique emotional purpose, eliciting specific psychological and physiological responses in viewers. This diversity underscores cinema's powerful ability to provoke varied and complex emotional reactions.
