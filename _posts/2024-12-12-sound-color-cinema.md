In the early days of cinema, much like in Babylon where Nellie LaRoy danced her way into silent film stardom, movies were a feast for the eyes but not yet for the ears. The world of Hollywood was chaotic, glamorous, and ripe for innovation. Then came the turning points that changed everything: the introduction of color in 1922 and sound in 1927.  

These groundbreaking advancements didn’t just change how films were made; they revolutionized the emotional language of cinema. Joy, fear, and disgust—emotions that had already found a place on the silent screen—shifted in prominence.

## **The rise of joy: when movies learned to speak and shine**  

Before 1922, emotions in films were expressed through exaggerated gestures, silent stares, and title cards. Joy existed, but it was muted—struggling to shine through the monochrome lens of silent cinema. Nellie’s analysis shows a clear breakthrough: the arrival of color and sound brought joy to life.

1. **The advent of color (1922)**: Suddenly, movies could glow with vibrant hues. Color allowed filmmakers to paint scenes of happiness and optimism with a visual richness that silent, black-and-white films lacked. Emotions like joy became brighter, bolder, and more memorable.

2. **The power of sound (1927)**: Sound did more than give actors a voice. It added laughter, music, and rhythm, transforming movies into emotionally immersive experiences. Scenes that once relied on pantomime could now sweep audiences off their feet with songs, dialogue, and orchestral scores. The introduction of sound brought audiences closer to characters, making moments of happiness sing and sparkle in ways that silent films never could.

The graphs show this revolution clearly: movies made between 1930–1940 featured significantly more joy than films made before 1922. The emotional tone of cinema had shifted. For actors like Nellie LaRoy in Babylon, the transition to sound was both a promise and a curse. Joy surged on screen, but behind the scenes, chaos reigned. Many stars of silent cinema, celebrated for their expressive faces and larger-than-life gestures, couldn’t adapt to the demands of sound. The raw, untamed energy of Nellie’s performances didn’t translate well into the polished, vocal precision that sound films required.

But Nellie noticed something more in the data. While joy climbed to new heights, fear and disgust were also changing. Could these shifts be linked to global events? Her curiosity led her to investigate the impact of World War I on cinema’s emotional landscape.

## **A shadow of war: how world war I reshaped fear and disgust**

During the silent film era, fear and disgust were already present, but something changed after World War I. Before the war, films often portrayed discomfort or grotesque imagery, reflecting audiences’ fascination with the new medium. However, after the war, the emotional tone shifted.

1. **The decline of disgust**: Audiences had already witnessed unimaginable horrors during the war. Nellie’s analysis shows that filmmakers turned away from themes that evoked disgust, as viewers craved hope and escapism more than ever.

2. **The rise of fear**: At the same time, fear became more dominant. The war introduced new anxieties—conflict, loss, and a destabilized world—and cinema reflected this. Suspenseful narratives and stories of survival became tools to mirror collective anxieties while also helping audiences process them.

Just like Nellie couldn’t adapt when sound took over Hollywood, the film industry had to adapt to a world changed by war. Fear became a new emotional anchor, reflecting a society still grappling with its trauma.

## **The diverging faces of sadness after 9/11**

The emotional landscape of cinema shifted once again after the 9/11 attacks. Sadness, in particular, split into two distinct paths depending on the genre.

1. **Family/Animation**: Sadness dropped sharply. Post-9/11, family and animated films became more uplifting, offering audiences optimism and comfort in a time of grief. Filmmakers understood that younger audiences needed hope, not reminders of real-world sadness.

2. **Romance**: Sadness surged. Romance films leaned into themes of love, loss, and longing, providing a space for audiences to process their emotions. These films mirrored the collective grief of society but also offered catharsis through heartfelt stories of connection.

## **Conclusion: a story of innovation and emotion**

Through this analysis, Nellie uncovered how cinema evolved alongside history. Sound and color brought joy to the screen, but war and tragedy left their mark, shifting emotions like fear, disgust, and sadness. Just like in *Babylon*, where the rise of sound reshaped everything, movies have always reflected the world around them—its beauty, its chaos, and its heart.
