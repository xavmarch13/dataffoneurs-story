Come and dive in with us in the tornado of movie emotions ! We will be analyzing emotions intensity, their evolution and many more in general and through many genre and continents !

### Genre and continent distinction

While it would have been interesting to analyze the emotional trends of individual countries, such an approach would have made the scope of our work significantly larger. To streamline the analysis and focus on broader trends, we decided to group countries by their respective continents.

Similarly, the dataset contained over 300 unique genres, which would have made the analysis overly complex and fragmented. To address this, we consolidated these genres into broader categories that encapsulate common themes and characteristics. After careful consideration, we identified and retained eight major categories:

1. **Action/Adventure**  
2. **Drama**  
3. **Horror**  
4. **Family/Animation**  
5. **Comedy**  
6. **Thriller**  
7. **Romance**  
8. **Fantasy/Sci-Fi**
